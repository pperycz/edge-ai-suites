.. note::
   | There are known issues when deploying Robotics AI Suite with ROS2 Humble, where the underlying OS is Ubuntu 22.04 with kernel version less or equal 6.8. Such setups does not fully support GPU/NPU offload scenarios for 15th gen processors so only CPU-based examples should be used.

.. note::

   | Intel does not recommend running simulations, like Gazebo*, on a physical robot.
